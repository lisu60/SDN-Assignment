# How to use Git

## With PyCharm

### 1. Get a local copy of the repository

If it's your first time opening PyCharm, you might see the following window.
Click on "Get from VCS".

![get from vcs](https://github.com/lisu60/SDN-Assignment/blob/master/images/from-vcs-first-open.png?raw=true)

If you don't have that window, you can archive it by selecting "Git -> Clone...", 
as shown in the following figure:

![clone from git](https://github.com/lisu60/SDN-Assignment/blob/master/images/clone-from-git.png?raw=true)

In the next page, click "GitHub" on the left-hand side to login to GitHub with your GitHub account:

![login github](https://github.com/lisu60/SDN-Assignment/blob/master/images/login-github.png?raw=true)

After loggin in, you should be presented with a list of repositories that are accessible to your account. 
Select the "SDN-Assignment" repository and click "Clone":

![select repo](https://github.com/lisu60/SDN-Assignment/blob/master/images/select-repo.png?raw=true)

Now you should have got a local copy of the repository.
